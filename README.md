# Attribute-Based Person Re-Identification using Unity Synthetic Data

## Overview
This project investigates attribute-based person re-identification (Re-ID) models and improves performance by generating labeled synthetic datasets using the Unity game engine.

## Environment
- Unity Editor: 2022.3 LTS
- Render Pipeline: URP
- Unity Perception Package: 0.9.0-preview.2
- OS: Windows 11
- GPU: Intel Iris Xe

## Dataset Generation
- Perception Camera
- Automatic labeling (clothing color, accessories, etc.)
- Randomization (rotation, color, accessory toggle)

## How to Run
1. Open the project in Unity Hub
2. Load the sample scene
3. Press Play to generate synthetic images

## Features
- Shirt color randomization
- Pants color randomization
- Hat on/off randomization
- Character rotation randomization

## Notes
Due to storage constraints, full datasets are not included.
